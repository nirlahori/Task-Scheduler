# Task-Scheduler
Scheduler System for Multi Threaded Programs

Task Scheduler is a scheduler which lets the threads in a single process to schedule the execution of their work based on real time. The project is currently in progress and I am experimenting with many different things such as catching exceptions, specifying code that needs to be executed once the task is completed etc. So the code will be frequently updated.

Though the capability of the current system is limited but, I am planning to make the project feature-rich in future.
